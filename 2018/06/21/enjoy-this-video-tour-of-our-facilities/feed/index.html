		<description><![CDATA[Beds are cold and hard, service personnel are some of the grumpiest people ever met.  Doors apparently only lock and can&#039;t be opened from the inside.

The 1/2 is because at least it has walls, unlike the &quot;rustic&quot; tents at his other properties.]]></description>
