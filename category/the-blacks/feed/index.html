				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">Because we keep costs and expenditures to the bare minimum, foregoing such amenities as solid walls, raised beds, and sheets that need washing, guests at #TrumpHotels are charged absolutely nothing for their stay. Even better, we make every effort to ensure that when our guests leave, they return to a home where those savings will go much further than they would here.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">But that doesn&#8217;t mean we don&#8217;t have suggestions for where all those savings can be spent wisely. Here are three of our favorites:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">First, not everyone who stays in a #TrumpHotel has a home to return to. The</span> <a href="http://georgiaasylum.org">Georgia Asylum and Immigration Network</a> <span style="color: #000000;">provides free legal services to victims of crime and persecution, aiding those who love the opportunity and promise of America so much, they still want to stay even after they&#8217;ve experienced a #TrumpHotel in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Second, some people never have the chance to stay in a #TrumpHotel, but that means they also don&#8217;t reap all the benefits of the zero-cost accommodations we offer.</span> <a href="https://worldreliefatlanta.org/give">World Relief Atlanta</a> <span style="color: #000000;">offers assistance to refugees, including resettlement services, employment services, and legal aid to help them gain permanent residency or U.S. citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, not everyone is fortunate enough to visit America at all, much less experience the accommodations of a #TrumpHotel firsthand. And sadly, their living conditions can make our facilities look like the sort of elite and pompous vacation resorts that a self-important millionaire or billionaire would put his name on the side of in giant letters. The mere act of sleeping can expose you to terrible disease. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The</span> <a href="https://www.AgainstMalaria.com/LorenCollins">Against Malaria Foundation</a> <span style="color: #000000;">not only improves these peoples&#8217; lives through the simple act of providing bed nets, but it contributes 100% of every donated dollar to purchasing and distributing those nets. There may be no charity where each dollar given does more concrete good in the world than the AMF. And while #TrumpHotels may not believe in bedsheets or privacy or family togetherness, even we believe in keeping children from contracting malaria while they sleep.</span></p>
